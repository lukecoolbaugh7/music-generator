# Music Generation with LSTM Neural Network

## Overview

This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in Keras to generate music automatically. The neural network is trained on a dataset of MIDI files to understand and produce new musical sequences that mimic the learned style.

## Features

- **Data Processing:** Converts raw MIDI files into suitable input formats for neural networks.
- **Neural Network Training:** Employs LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies of musical notes.
- **Music Generation:** Generates music by predicting sequences of notes based on the trained model.
- **MIDI Output:** Converts generated note sequences back into MIDI files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Keras 2.3.1
- music21
- NumPy
- Glob

## Usage

1. **Training the model:**
   Run `lstm.py` to train the neural network. This script processes the MIDI files, creates the model, and trains it.

2. **Generating music:**
After training, use `predict.py` to generate new music sequences.

## Project Structure

- `lstm.py`: Script for training the LSTM network.
- `predict.py`: Script for generating music using the trained model.
- `midi_songs`: Directory conatining raw data of midi songs
- `data/notes`: File containing processed data generated by lstm.py
